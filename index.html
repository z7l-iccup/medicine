						<li><h3>Epilepsy in people with intellectual disability: Looking for solutions</h3><br>
						<p>There is a good awareness that adults with epilepsy and intellectual disability encounter more problems greater than the sum of the two conditions. While there has been recent work and discussions highlighting the complex nature of the problem, the discussion on possible evidence-based solution is scant.</p></li>
						<li><h3>Health and work beyond COVID-19</h3> <br>
						<p>Join us to consider the emerging issues for health and work as we transition from the constraints in 2020 and early-2021 due to COVID-19, and what this means for occupational health practice for the coming months and years.</p></li>
						<li><h3>Psychiatry and palliative care study day</h3> <br>
						<p>This webinar provides a unique opportunity to cross boundaries between palliative care and mental healthcare in order to learn how best to care for patients with mental and physical health multimorbidity. Speakers will explore the latest advances in the field including end-of-life dementia care, approaching palliative care in those with severe mental illness and implementing end-of-life care packages for those with cognitive impairments. </p></li>
